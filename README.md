# MaChanger
 MAC address changer for linux and macOS.
 I simply used the class structure, although it is not necessary to use it as I want to keep my knowledge fresh.
# Usage

 --i      / Interface name <br>
 --m     / New MAC address <br>

  FOR EXAMPLE
 'python main.py --i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55'
